      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I've always been passionate about building things. I majored in engineering
        and was a successful engineer in the automotive and aerospace industries where
        I worked as an Industrialization Engineer focused on new products and processes.
        This work heavily involved the use of statistics and statistical programming which
        is how I originally became interested in software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        After learning how to write code it quickly became a new interest both personally 
        and professionally. I absolutely enjoy the problem solving and engineering aspects
        of developing software and understand the benefits high quality software can bring
        to a business.
